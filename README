A trivial tool to convert plain text into a multipart/alternative message


This program exists because of the Outlook behavior documented in MS KB 287816
which was making the output of an audit script script look ugly and confusing
for Outlook users. It converts plain text from stdin into a
multipart/alternative e-mail message with text/plain and text/html parts.

The tool is provided with Debian packaging because that's what's easiest to
distribute with our management infrastructure. To build packages for testing,
install git-buildpackage, ensure your pbuilder is working, then:

    BUILDER=pbuilder git-buildpackage  --git-ignore-branch --git-dist=wheezy

For release:

    BUILDER=pbuilder git-buildpackage  --git-dist=wheezy


Example usage:

  Replace e.g.:

    my-reportmaker --fnord | mail -s 'My Report' people@example.com

  with:

    my-reportmaker --fnord | mimemailify -s 'My Report' people@example.com
